## Task 0 : OSI model  

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

In this project we will mainly focus on:

The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
On the Network layer with IP and ICMP
The image bellow describes more concretely how you can relate to every level.

### Question 0: 

What is the OSI model?

1- Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect  
2- The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology  
3- The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology  

--> The correct answer is : 2- The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.  

### Question 1: 

How is the OSI model organized?

1- Alphabetically  
2- From the lowest to the highest level  
3- Randomly  

--> The correct answer is : 2- From the lowest to the highest level.  

## Task 1. Types of network

LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.  

### Question 0:

What type of network a computer in local is connected to?  

1- Internet  
2- WAN  
3- LAN  

--> The correct answer is : 3- LAN (Local Area Network).  
A LAN is a network that covers a relatively small geographical area, such as a home, office, or building. It allows devices within that area to communicate with each other and share resources like files, printers, and internet access.  


### Question 1: 

What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?  

1- Internet  
2- WAN  
3- LAN  

--> The correct answer is : 2- WAN (Wide Area Network).  
A WAN is a network that spans a larger geographical area, such as multiple buildings, cities, or even countries. It enables the interconnection of LANs over long distances, providing connectivity between geographically dispersed locations. The internet is often used as a means to establish a WAN connection between remote offices, utilizing various networking technologies such as leased lines, MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), VPN (Virtual Private Network), or other wide area networking solutions.  

### Question 2: 

What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?  

1- Internet  
2- WAN  
3- LAN  

--> The correct answer is : 1- Internet  
The Internet is a global network of networks that allows devices from different locations to communicate and access online resources. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, connect to the Internet using cellular data networks provided by mobile service providers. This enables users to access websites, services, and applications from anywhere with cellular coverage.
